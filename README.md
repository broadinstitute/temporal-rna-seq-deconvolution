# Temporal RNA-seq Deconvolution (TeRNAdecov)

TeRNAdecov is a package for deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq samples from time series using single-cell datasets. It allows for simultaneous inference of sample-specific composition as well as overall time trajectory dynamics using highly scalable stochastic variational inference.
